Python Essentials II
==============================

When compared to other `scripting languages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language>`_ Python code is often
noted for it's high level of readability. This is in part due to enforced spacing that is built into the code itself.
It goes far beyond spacing and further details can be found in the
`PEP 8 -- Style Guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.  In this lesson you will learn more about what
it means to write *pythonic code*.

You will continue to learn how to `control the flow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow>`_ of you Python code,
ultimately gaining more granularity in how you can accomplish tasks with code.  An important part of being able to
write code that specifically performs what you intend is to ensure that you are familiar with the logical operators.
Finally, there will be an introduction to debugging in Python, which is a element of all programming languages that is
needed to produce code in a timely manner.
