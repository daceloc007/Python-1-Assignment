Python Essentials I
==============================

For some of you this is your first programming language and for others this will be an additional language that you add
to your toolbox.  Python has become the most popular language used by data professionals in industry today.  Python
can be used for full-stack development, high-performance computing, backend development, data science and so much more.
In this lesson we will work though introducing the language to you.

All programming languages use code to accomplish a specific task.  We will first ensure that you can *execute* code and
there are a number of way to do this with Python ranging from executing code that is saved in a file to executing code
in an environment that is interactive like the experience you have with a calculator.  Once your are comfortable
executing code we will introduce the data types and data containers (also known as data structures) that are the
fundamental units of Python code.
