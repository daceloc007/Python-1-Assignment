# Python Essentials II - Assignment

- Part I: Practice with `for` Loops 
- Part II: Practice with `while` Loops
- Part III: Practice with `list comprehensions`

## Instructions

We'll be working through problems designed to get your hands on everything you learned - strings and lists 
(and their methods), along with iteration using for loops. The goal of is to get more comfortable with Python, and 
working with its data structures. We're also going to work on getting more familiar with some of the methods that are 
available to us for interacting with strings and lists. Remember that from the IPython terminal, we can find any of the 
methods that are available on an object via tab completion. That should come in handy tonight!

## Part 1 - Practice with `for` Loops

For the first part here, take a couple of the scripts we wrote in the `intro_python_assignment.md`, and change them from using `while` loops to using `for` loops. Start out and just do the first two (for extra practice you could do this with the rest of the problems we worked through):

1. Write a script that computes and prints the factorial of a user inputted number.
2. Write a script that determines whether or not a user inputted number is a prime and prints 'The number you inputted is a prime/ not a prime number.' depending on what your script finds.

Remember, the goal is to write these by using `for` loops.

## Part II - Practice with `while` loops

pass

## Part III - Practice with comprehensions

1. Write a script that creates a list of only the even numbers between 0 and a user inputted number.

2. Write a script that creates a list of only numbers divisible by a user inputted number that are between 0 and a user 
inputted number (**Hint**: Use `input()` twice to get both of the user inputs).

3. Given the list `[0, 3, 6, 9, 10, 2, 5]` and `[2, 6, 4, 7, 8, 1, 15]`, write a script that finds the common elements 
between them. Store them in a list, and print that list, sorted, as the final output (if you'd like you can go ahead and 
hard code those lists in your script).

4. For a user inputted number, write a script that outputs a list of multiples of that number from 0 up to another user 
inputted number. For example, given the numbers 4 and 20, your script should print the numbers 4, 8, 12, and 16.

### Extra Credit

Alter your script in Part 3, Question 3 to accept arbitrary lists. Build it such that the user has to enter 7 numbers 
(each separated by an enter at the command line) for each list.
